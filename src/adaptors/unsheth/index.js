//TODO: Notes for llama team:
// We calculate the yield for unshETH staking farms
// 1) We are calculating the base APR of unshETH based on the weighted average of the underlying LSD APR.
// -- For each of the underlying LSDs, we use their official API to pull their APR, except for cbETH
// -- For cbETH we use the DefiLlama calculation and import it directly since there's no official API (pls let us know if this is ok)
// 2) We are calculating the farm APR for unshETH based on the USH emissions
// .
// We are also including the yield for USH-WETH and USH-WBNB LPs on Sushi and PancakeSwap.  These are pool2 yields:
// 1) For the base APR based on trading volume, we're pulling using Sushi and Pancakeswap APIs
// -- For the PancakeSwap API, we're using the NodeReal subgraph URL as used in official PancakeSwap repo. If there's a official Defillama API Key, pls let us know how to include it (we included a free API key)
// -- Maybe we weren't looking properly, but we didn't see any Pancakeswap pool2 in the yield section?
// 2) Farm APR is based on the USH emissions
// .
// How do we get properly listed with the right attributes on Defillama?
// 1) We would like to represent unshETH as a single-sided ETH staking yield with no IL.
// -- For unshETH on ETH Mainnet, the underlying asset is mainnet ETH.  For the adapter, we said it is WETH (which is how cbETH adapter does it)
// -- For BNB Chain, the underlying asset is technically still mainnet ETH.  For the adapter, we said it is Binance-pegged ETH
// 2) We are an audited farm.  Audit link is: https://unsheth.xyz/v2-audit.pdf
// .
